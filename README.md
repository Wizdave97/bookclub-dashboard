### Quidax UI Challenge

## Acessing the project

# Method 1
Install Node.js on your local machine  
At the root of the project run `npm install` to install the dependencies
The only dependency is `lite-server` a simple development server  
Run `npm start` to start the development server
Access the webpage on `localhost:3000`

# Alternatively

Copy the full path of the `index.html` file
Paste it in your browser address bar and go

## Assumptions I have made concerning the project

I have added a third breakpoint to make the app display well on tablets


## Constructive feed back 

I think test takers should be allowed to use a utility only CSS framework such as Tailwind CSS
With such a framework you can still test the person's understanding of core CSS fundamentals properly 
while speeding up the development process for the test taker.
